Diagnostic Mapping
==================

The Safety Manual for the device provides a list of diagnostics - some are hardware-based and some require software. The SDL provides a table that shows the mapping of software diagnostics for modules supported in this release to the corresponding SDL software API(s) and any reference example.

The Diagnostic Mapping is provided along with the CSP package. Please contact your TI representative for access to the SDL CSP.
