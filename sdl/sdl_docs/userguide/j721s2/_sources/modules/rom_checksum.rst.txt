ROM_CHECKSUM: ROM Checksum Module
=================================

Introduction
------------

ROM Checksum is a feature that is used to check the integrity of the data. 
Its work is to take a set of data associated with the memory regions of ROM and perform checksum on that data and then compare that resultant data value against a pre-determined golden vector value (golden vector has the expected value which should come as a result of 512-bit of hash message, 
golden vector is already defined and it has fixed address in ROM region). 

This module provides the following functionality:

*  Ability initialize the ROM Checksum
* Ability to process the data of ROM region
* Ability to compress the data of ROM region and store the result in buffer
* Ability to compare resultant data with golden value (golden value has the expected value which should come as a result of 512-bit of hash message, golden value is already defined and it has fixed address in ROM region)

Example Usage
-------------
The following shows an example of SDL ROM CHECKSUM API usage by the application to check the integrity of data at ROM region.

Compute the ROM Checksum
    .. code:: bash

        testResult = SDL_ROM_Checksum_compute();
        if(testResult != SDL_PASS)
        {
            //Intigrity check failed
        }
        
Examples
--------

The ROM checksum module provides a test app that demonstrates the ROM checksum functionality. Details of the test app name, location and build instructions are given in the table below.
