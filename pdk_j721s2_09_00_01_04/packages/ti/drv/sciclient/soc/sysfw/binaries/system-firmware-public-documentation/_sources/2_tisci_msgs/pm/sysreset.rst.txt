TISCI PM System Reset API Documentation
=======================================

This document describes the TISCI API for issuing warm reset to a domain.

.. _pm_sysreset_msg_sys_reset:

TISCI_MSG_SYS_RESET
===================

Objective
----------

Request for a software warm reset of a domain.

Usage
-----

+------------------------+--------+
| **Message Type**       | Normal |

| **Secure Queue Only?** | No     |
+------------------------+--------+

User can use this API to issue software warm reset of a domain. The domain
definition may vary from SoC to SoC. Depending on the SoC, certain domain
reset could be defined to be equivalent to a system-wide reset. The reset
brings the device or part of the device to a known state after events such
as power-up, hardware request, or software request. The domain reset can
be used for error handling and recovery.

To maintain backward compatibility, when a user leaves the domain parameter
empty, the API would process the message with the DOMGRP_COMPATIBILITY as
the domain value.

After calling the TISCI_MSG_SYS_RESET API, the chosen domain will be
deinitialized. The user is responsible for reconfiguring the devices in the
chosen domain by resending the board configuration for baseport, power
management, resource management, and security management. If the chosen
domain reset would lead to system-wide reset, then no additional board
configuration calls are necessary.

.. note::
  On AM62x, AM64x and AM62Ax devices the module parameter is unused. On these
  devices this API will result in a system-wide warm reset, or
  if MCU reset isolation is enabled, a MAIN domain only reset.

To maintain backward compatibility, when a user does not pass the domain
argument, it would perform the SoC's default reset behavior.
