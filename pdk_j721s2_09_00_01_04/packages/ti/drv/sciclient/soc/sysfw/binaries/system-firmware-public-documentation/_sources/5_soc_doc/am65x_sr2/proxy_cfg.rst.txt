AM65X_SR2 Proxy Device Descriptions
===================================

Introduction
============

This chapter provides information on the Proxy devices in the AM65X_SR2 SoC.
Some System Firmware TISCI messages take device specific inputs. This chapter
provides information on the valid values for Proxy TISCI message parameters.

Proxy Device IDs
================

Some System Firmware TISCI message APIs require the Proxy device ID be provided
as part of the request. Based on :doc:`AM65X_SR2 Device IDs <devices>` these are
the valid Proxy device IDs.

+---------------------------+-------------------+
| Proxy Device Name         |   Proxy Device ID |
+===========================+===================+
| AM6_DEV_NAVSS0_PROXY0     |               185 |
+---------------------------+-------------------+
| AM6_DEV_MCU_NAVSS0_PROXY0 |               191 |
+---------------------------+-------------------+

Proxy Indices
=============

This section describes Proxy indices.  The proxy index is used in some Proxy
based TISCI messages.
