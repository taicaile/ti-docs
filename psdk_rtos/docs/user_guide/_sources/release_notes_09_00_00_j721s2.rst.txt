Upgrade and Compatibility
-------------------------
In this section, we only highlight a few significant changes in this SDK.  For full list of upgrade and
compatibility topics, please refer to individual components release notes :ref:`sdk_components`.

Enet LLD
^^^^^^^^
Support for scatter-gather in packet transmission has been added starting in 08.05.00 release.  This feature
requires a change in Enet LLD DMA API, so applications using Enet LLD APIs need to be ported to use the updated
API.  Developers should refer to the porting steps documented in Enet LLD User's Guide (|enet_sg_porting_guide|).

MCU Software (MCUSW)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ethernet
""""""""
MCAL Ethernet (MCU CPSW_2G) drivers have been signficantly refactored to remove most dependencies with
other SDK components, such as Enet LLD and UDMA LLD. The only remaining SDK dependency is with SCI Client driver.
The driver configuration has also moved to a static-oriented allocation approach for TX channel, RX channel,
Ring Accs, and other resources.
Please refer to the Ethernet User Guide (|mcusw_eth_user_guide|) chapter in the MCUSW documentation
for further information about Ethernet module configuration.

Additionally, MCAL Ethernet driver (MCU CPSW_2G) now has Global Time support (packet timestamping) as well as
support for *link time* and *post-build* configuration, in addition to *pre-compile* variant already supported.

MCAL Ethernet driver is *not* supported in Main domain CPSW 2G (CPSW_2G).
